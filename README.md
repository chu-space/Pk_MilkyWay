# Pk_MilkyWay
Reconstructing  linear matter power spectrum P(k) using observations of the Milky Way satellite population for scales smaller than 1 megaparsec.

The first step of this constraining problem is to identify the cross-sections at which the velocity-dependent interacting dark matter (IDM) models sufficiently match or is suppressed below the Warm Dark Matter (WDM). 

We do this by finding the envelope cross-section, at which the transfer function or the ratio between the matter power spectrum and the benchmark CDM power spectrum. In this directory, you can gain access to some reference transfer functions to check if your intermediate mass  (looking in between the suspected masses of IDM) or middle (interpolating in between the halfmode and envelope cross-sections) cross-sections match the expected transfer function behaviour we expect.

You can compare with reference transfer functions in COZMIC_IDM_Tk, access the reference CAMB data from camb_data_tk. Inspect sample CLASS parameter ini files in params_test_output. Look at sample simulation setups in simulation_setups.
